# Kopfschmerzkalender-Generator

## Goal

The **Kopfschmerzkalender-Generator** is a tool designed to alleviate the burden of creating and maintaining headache diaries (Kopfschmerzkalender) for medical purposes. For patients with chronic migraines and headaches, the daily task of manually recording detailed information can be overwhelming and counterproductive.

Common challenges include:

- Remembering to log each headache episode while in pain
- Accurately recalling the type, intensity, and duration of each headache
- Tracking associated symptoms and triggers
- Documenting medication usage and effectiveness
- Maintaining consistent record-keeping, especially during severe episodes

This constant focus on pain can become a source of stress and anxiety. Ironically, it may even **worsen** the condition patients are trying to manage.

As a chronic migraine sufferer myself, I understand these challenges firsthand. I found that meticulously filling out a Kopfschmerzkalender for medical professionals was not only m√ºhsam (tedious) but often invited more headaches than it helped alleviate. 

The **Kopfschmerzkalender-Generator** aims to address these issues. By automating and simplifying the process, it provides a peaceful, less stressful way for patients to maintain vital health information. This tool ensures that care providers still receive the data they need, without adding unnecessary strain on the patient.

## Features

- Generate Kopfschmerzkalender in Excel format
- Customizable settings for medications, intensity, and frequency
- User-friendly GUI for easy configuration
- Sample data generation for demonstration purposes
- Mehrsprachig (multi-language) support (English and Deutsch)
